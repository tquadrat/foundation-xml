        <p>The Foundation set of libraries is a collection of classes and
        related tools that have been proved to be useful for our daily
        programming work. One goal in writing this code was to use always the
        latest Java, together with the most recent state-of-the-art coding
        techniques. We also put a lot of strength on the documentation
        of our code, so hopefully there are not any questions remaining after
        studying this JavaDoc.</p>
        <p>Another goal when creating this library was to provide JUnit tests
        for all classes and their methods. Unfortunately, this is a work in
        progress, but we are on a good way.</p>
        <p>This module <code>org.tquadrat.foundation.xml</code> contains
        classes that deal with XML, both generation and parsing.</p>
